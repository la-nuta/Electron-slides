                Have you ever wondered if you can build cross-platform desktop apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?
                It is possible with Electron.
                Like many famous people Electron was born with a different name. It was
                born as Atom Shell because it was built for Atom. But it became clear as more
                people were using Electron that it really needed to have its own name and
                not always be tied to the text editor Atom.

                Why Electron is popular?
                Developing desktop applications can be full of challenges that make it difficult to approach.

                You need to think not only about structure and desing of app,
                but also about such thinds like packaging, installation and managing updates.

                Supporting multiple platforms often means untangling sets of specialized tools or
                navigating the nuances of a whole new programming language.

                Web apps by comparison seem so easy because most everybody has a web browser
                installed and modern browsers even come loaded with powerful debugging tools.

                They rely on universal cross-platform languages.

                But even web apps have certain limitations.
                Crafting conditional rules for different browser versions can be more painful than writing code
                for different operating systems

                Web apps also limit your ability to interact with the file system and can tend to let a
                slow network connection throughout their performance.

                Electron uses webpages for creating user interfaces.

                You can think of an electron app is kind of a minimal web browser with the
                ability to interact with the local file system.

                And this web browser is part of your applications packaging.

                Electron apps are compatible with Mac, Windows, and Linux operating systems right out of the box.

                    Before to begin to create an app with Electron you need to install Node.js.
                    Since an Electron app is just a fancy Node.js app, you will need to have npm installed

                    You also should have a GitHub account to store and update your app.
                    Although an account isn’t necessary, but it’s recommended.

                    npm install - This will create a node_modules folder containing all the Node.js dependencies
                    required for the app to work.

                    Here, we will talk about the most essential files in any electron app.
                    Let's start with package.json, which holds various information about the project, such as the version,
                    npm dependencies and other important settings.

                    The most significant thing to note here is the scripts property,
                    where we've defined the npm start command, allowing us to run the app.
                    When we call it, we ask electron to run the main.js file.
                    This JS file contains a short script that opens
                    the app window, and defines some options and event handlers.

                    npm start - The app should open up in it's own window. Notice it has a top menu bar.

                    This starting the app is just the developer's way of running an Electron app.
                    When packaged it will be installed like a normal program and opened like one,
                    just by double clicking on its icon.

                    To make your app ready for end users you need to package it.

                    Since Electron apps can work on multiple operating systems and every OS is different,
                    there need to be separate distributions for Windows, for OS X and for Linux.

                    All these things sum up and the final result is an app that is roughly 50mb in size.
                    This is quite a lot and isn't practical for a simple app,
                    but this becomes irrelevant to big, complex applications.
