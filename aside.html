ELECTRON
   (formerly known as Atom Shell
is an open-source cross-platform framework for creating native applications
        with web technologies created and maintained by GitHub


    https://electronjs.org

        Have you ever wondered if you can build cross-platform desktop apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?
        It is possible with Electron.
        like many famous people Electron was born with a different name it was
        born as Atom Shell because it was built for Atom but it became clear as more
        people were using Electron that it really needed to have its own name and
        not always be tied to the text editor Atom



                   Milestones in Electron's history
                    April 2013    Atom Shell is started

                    May 2014   Atom Shell is open sourced

                    April 2015    Atom Shell is re-named Electron

                    May 2016   Electron releases v1.0.0

                    May 2016
        Electron apps compatible with Mac App Store

                    August 2016   Windows Store support for Electron apps


        Applications using Electron

Electron has since been used to create applications by GitHub and also by such companies like Microsoft,
Facebook, Slack, and Docker


        Web Technologies
     uses Chromium and Node.js to build an app with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Open Source
            open source project maintained by GitHub and an active community of contributors</p>

Cross Platform compatible with Mac, Windows, and Linux



        Why Electron is popular?
        Developing desktop applications can be full
        of challenges that make it difficult to approach.

        You need to think not only about structure and desing of app,
        but also about such thinds like packaging, installation and managing updates

        Supporting multiple platforms often means
        untangling sets of specialized tools or
        navigating the nuances of a whole new
        programming language.

        Web apps by comparison seem so easy because
        most everybody has a web browser
        installed and modern browsers even come
        loaded with powerful debugging tools.

        They rely on universal cross-platform
        languages

        But even web apps have certain limitations

        crafting conditional rules
        for different browser versions
        can be more painful than writing code
        for different operating systems

        web apps also limit your ability to interact with
        the file system and can tend to let a
        slow network connection throughout their performance


        Electron uses
        webpages for creating user interfaces

        You can think of an electron app is kind
        of a minimal web browser with the
        ability to interact with the local file
        system

        And this web browser is part of
        your applications packaging

        In addition to its core set
        of APIs Electron also includes all of
        chromium APIs and all of node.js, is built
        in modules and fully supports third
        party modules

        Electron apps are compatible with Mac, Windows, and Linux operating systems
        right out of the box.



The hard parts made easy
Automatic updates

AutoUpdater enables apps to automatically update themselves

Native menus & notifications

Class Menu helps to create native application menus and context menus (according style of application
            menu Windows, Linux or macOS)

Crash reporting

CrashReporter submits crash reports to a remote server

Debugging & profiling

ContentTracing - collect tracing data from Chromium's content module for finding performance
            bottlenecks and slow operations

Chrome Developer Tools
Devtron

            Devtron - Electron DevTools Extension, an open source tool to help you inspect, monitor,
            and debug your Electron app
Testing
            Spectron - Electron Testing Framework, an open source framework for easily writing
            integrations tests for your Electron app
            Spectron sets up and tears down your app and allows it to be test-driven remotely with full support
            for the Electron APIs. Built on top of ChromeDriver and WebDriverIO


Windows installers

        Other in-built features are:
        1. Automatic updates — enable apps to automatically update themselves
        2. Native menus and notifications — creates native application menus and context menus (according style
        of application
        menu Windows, Linux or macOS)
        3. App crash reporting — you can submit crash reports to a remote server
        4. Debugging and profiling — Chromium’s content module finds performance bottlenecks and slow
        operations. You can also use your favorite Chrome Developer Tools within your app.
        5. Windows installer — you can create install packages. Fast and simple.



how does it work?


    A most basic Electron app would have the following folder structure

            your-app/
             ├── package.json
             ├── main.js
             └── index.html

            A basic Electron application needs just these files:

            package.json - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
            main.js - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's main
            process.
            index.html - A web page to render. This is the app's renderer process.


Application's structure

Main process
runs package.json's main script:
- displays a GUI
- creates web pages by creating BrowserWindow instances
Renderer process
each webpage runs its own isolated process

            An Electron app always has one main process, but never more.

            The script that runs in the main process can display a GUI by creating web pages.

            It creates web pages by creating BrowserWindow instances.

            An Electron app always has one main process, but never more.
            Since Electron uses Chromium for displaying web pages,
            Chromium's multi-process architecture is also used.

            Since Electron uses Chromium for displaying web pages,
            Chromium's multi-process architecture is also used.

Installing Electron
install Node.js
$ npm install -g electron
$ npm install --save-dev electron

            Before to begin to create an app with Electron you need to install Node.js.
            Since an Electron app is just a fancy Node.js app, you will need to have npm installed

            You also should have a GitHub account to store and update your app.
            Although an account isn’t necessary, but it’s recommended.

            npm install - This will create a node_modules folder containing all the Node.js dependencies
            required for the app to work.

running the app: $ npm start

            Here, we will talk about the most essential files in any electron app.
            Let's start with package.json, which holds various information about the project, such as the version,
            npm dependencies and other important settings.

            The most significant thing to note here is the scripts property,
            where we've defined the npm start command, allowing us to run the app.
            When we call it, we ask electron to run the main.js file.
            This JS file contains a short script that opens
            the app window, and defines some options and event handlers.

            npm start - The app should open up in it's own window. Notice it has a top menu bar.

            This starting the app is just the developer's way of running an Electron app.
            When packaged for the public, the it will be installed like a normal program and opened like one,
            just by double clicking on its icon.



            const {app, BrowserWindow} = require('electron');
            const path = require('path');
            const url = require('url');

            // Keep a global reference of the window object, if you don't, the window will
            // be closed automatically when the JavaScript object is garbage collected.
            let win;

            function createWindow () {
            // Create the browser window.
            win = new BrowserWindow({width: 800, height: 600});

            // and load the index.html of the app.
            win.loadURL(url.format({
            pathname: path.join(__dirname, 'index.html'),
            protocol: 'file:',
            slashes: true
            }));

            // Open the DevTools.
            win.webContents.openDevTools()

            // Emitted when the window is closed.
            win.on('closed', () => {
            // Dereference the window object, usually you would store windows
            // in an array if your app supports multi windows, this is the time
            // when you should delete the corresponding element.
            win = null
            })
            }

            // This method will be called when Electron has finished
            // initialization and is ready to create browser windows.
            // Some APIs can only be used after this event occurs.
            app.on('ready', createWindow)

            // Quit when all windows are closed.
            app.on('window-all-closed', () => {
            // On macOS it is common for applications and their menu bar
            // to stay active until the user quits explicitly with Cmd + Q
            if (process.platform !== 'darwin') {
            app.quit()
            }
            })

            app.on('activate', () => {
            // On macOS it's common to re-create a window in the app when the
            // dock icon is clicked and there are no other windows open.
            if (win === null) {
            createWindow()
            }
            })

            // In this file you can include the rest of your app's specific main process
            // code. You can also put them in separate files and require them here.


            First we define a browser window and set it's initial size.
            Then, we load the index.html file in it, which works similarly to opening a HTML file in your browser.

Packaging and Distribution

Electron Packager -> app into an executable file:
- double click on users' machines<
- assets, node.js modules,
            minified WebKit browser

        Separate distributions for different OS


            To make your app ready for end users you need to package it.

            Since Electron apps can work on multiple operating systems and every OS is different,
            there need to be separate distributions for Windows, for OS X and for Linux.

            All these things sum up and the final result is an app that is roughly 50mb in size.
            This is quite a lot and isn't practical for a simple app,
            but this becomes irrelevant to big, complex applications.
